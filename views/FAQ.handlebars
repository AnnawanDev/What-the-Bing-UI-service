    <h1>What the Bing?! Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    <p class="question">Are you sure the image results are family friendly?</p>
    <p class="answer">Mostly. The Bing Image Search API has a filter that *should*
      remove objectionable images, but there exists the possibility that Microsoft's
      filter didn't properly catch something.  If that's the case, please report the
      incident by sending a note to Ed at wiede@oregonstate.edu.  If you can, please
      send the search term.  I'll remove the term from the list.</p>

    <p class="question">What's the inspiration to this game?</p>
    <p class="answer">This game is based on an old Adobe Flash game called
      "Guess the Google", developed by Grant Skinner.  That game had a similar
      premise where users were presented images based on a Google search term and the
      player had to guess the search term used while time allows.</p>
    <p class="answer">Since the game was built using Flash, the game does not exist anywhere, but there
      are a couple references to it on the internet if you search hard enough. Below is a
    graphic of what the original game looked like.  If you clidk the image, you'll be taken
  to a game review from 2005,</p>

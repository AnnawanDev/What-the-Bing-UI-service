This is the UI service for the "What the Bing?" Game


## What the Bing?
Long ago there was a Flash game that I thought was really inventive.  It was developed by Grant Skinner and was called “Guess the Google”.  The user was presented with 9 images and they had to guess what search term was used that resulted in the images.  If they got it right, then they were presented with a new batch of images to guess.  If they got it wrong, they had to keep guessing as time allowed.  I thought I would try to recreate this game as best I can.
